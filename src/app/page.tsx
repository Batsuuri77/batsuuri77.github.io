          In my work experience, I have consistently encountered problems that
          can be solved through technology solutions. Realizing that technology
          is the best way to increase productivity and reduce unnecessary
          expenses in the workplace, I decided to expand my skill set with a new
          major. I began by learning basic coding, such as HTML tags and their
          usage, as well as CSS for basic styling. However, I found JavaScript
          challenging to fully grasp on my own. This led me to pursue formal
          education at a university in Australia. In addition to my technical
          skills, I pride myself on being an excellent observer. This quality
          allows me to keenly analyze situations and identify opportunities for
          improvement. I am also adept at finding creative solutions to
          problems, which has proven valuable for company development
          initiatives. Overall, my disciplined approach, collaborative nature,
          and commitment to continuous improvement make me a valuable asset to
          any team or company..
